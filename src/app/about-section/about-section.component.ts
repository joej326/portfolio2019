  aboutMe = `I was born and raised in the small and little-known town of Novato, California.

  At the age of 20  I accepted a job offer in Melbourne, Florida to work my first professional job
  as a Software Developer.

  At this position, I worked as a front-end Angular 2 developer for two years. It was a contracting
  position for the US government, and my primary responsibility was building features as they
  were requested from the higher-ups as well as fixing defects. My proudest accomplishment at
  that position is becoming the go-to guy in the office for writing unit tests in the Jasmine framework.

  Iâ€™m currently working as a full-stack developer for Veristream in Orlando, Florida.
  I work with a small team which has helped me learn how to communicate effectively
  and take on a lot of responsibility.

  Learning and teaching are two of my most favorite things in the world and I hope we can learn from eachother!`;
