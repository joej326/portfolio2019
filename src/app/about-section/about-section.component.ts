  aboutMe = `I was born and raised in California.

  At the age of 20  I received a job offer in Melbourne, FL to work my first professional job
  as a Software Developer.

  The move was a big one, considering I was leaving behind my friends and family to reside in
  Florida where I didnâ€™t know anyone. The journey has proved invaluable to me as it has taught
  me how to live independently and make meaningful connections in a world where people are
  becoming increasingly socially isolated.

  A passion of mine besides developing software is philosophy, more particularly existentialism.
  Conversing about how one should live a meaningful life makes me giddy simply at the thought of it!

  My hobbies include:
  coding, reading, writing, longboarding, rollerblading, going to the gym, and teaching.`;
