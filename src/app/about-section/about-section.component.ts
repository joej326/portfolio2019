  aboutMe = `I was born and raised in the small and little-known town of Novato, California.

  At the age of 20  I accepted a job offer in Melbourne, Florida to work my first professional job
  as a Software Developer.

  The move was a big one, considering I was leaving behind my friends and family to reside in
  Florida where I didnâ€™t know anyone. The journey has proven invaluable to me as it taught me how
  to live independently and meet interesting people in a world where people are becoming
  increasingly socially isolated.

  A passion of mine other than developing software is philosophy. More particularly existentialism.
  Contemplating how we can live meaningful lives makes me giddy simply thinking about it!

  My hobbies include:
  coding, reading, writing, longboarding, rollerblading, fitness, and teaching.`;
